# Penetration Testing
Penetration Testing (Pen Testing) is a method to find security vulnerabilities on software/hardware that has already being developed and deployed. This is the last line of defense against a breach.  

# Engagement Phases
An **Engagement** is the structured process of execute Pen Testing. It can be divided in multiple equally-important phases.
- **Goals and Objectives**
- **Rules of Engagement**
- **Engagement**
- **Reporting**

## Goals and Objectives
**Goals and Objectives** describe why an engagement is desired (what is valuable, risks at loosing it), and when the pen team is allowed to execute its tests. Those two should enable one to define the resources (team crew) needed to execute it.  
In Summary:  
- Goals (***WHY***)
- Scope (***WHAT***)
- Timeframe (***WHEN***)
- Pen Team Crew (***WHO***)

## Rules of Engagement
The **Rules of Engagement** (**RoE**) define the limits the methods allowed and where the pen team is permitted to operate.
In Summary:  
- Methods dis/allowed (***HOW***)
- Remote/Local/Physical access (***WHERE***)
